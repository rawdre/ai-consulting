## 🔥 BUT MEMBERSHIPS ARE JUST THE BEGINNING...

### Revenue Streams You're Also Losing

When a lead doesn't convert to a member, you don't just lose the R$200/month membership. You lose **everything that member would have bought:**

| Additional Revenue Stream | Avg Monthly/Per Member | Annual (per member) |
|---|---|---|
| 🏋️ Personal Training (1-2x/week) | R$400-800 | R$4,800-9,600 |

### True Customer Value (Membership + Upsells)

| Metric | Membership Only | With Upsells (conservative 30% buy) |
|---|---|---|
| LTV per member | R$1,700 | R$1,700 + R$2,664 = **R$4,364** |
| Per lost lead (potential) | R$1,700 | **R$4,364** |

### Real Annual Loss Across Network (with upsell potential)

| Locations | Lost Leads/Year | Membership Loss | + Upsell Loss (30%) | **TOTAL LOST** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **5 locations** | 1,584 | R$2,692,800 | R$1,267,258 | **R$3,960,058** |
